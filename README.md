# Problem-Solving
We will work on solving Mr. Mostafa Saad's problem-solving sheet, which consists of approximately 950 problems.

## Importants Notes

##### Understanding the Problem
###### Read Carefully: Understand every part of the problem.
Define Inputs/Outputs: Identify given inputs and expected outputs.
Break Down: Split the problem into smaller parts.

##### Planning the Solution

###### Choose Approach: Select suitable algorithms or data structures.
Consider Edge Cases: Think about special cases that might affect your solution.
Plan First: Write pseudocode or steps before coding.

##### Implementing the Solution
###### Start Simple: Begin with a basic version of the solution.
Build Incrementally: Add complexity step by step, testing as you go.
Use Functions: Break code into functions for readability.

##### Debugging
###### Syntax Check: Ensure your code is free of syntax errors.
Print Statements: Use print statements to track code behavior.
Test Varied Inputs: Use different test cases, including edge cases.

##### Optimization
###### Analyze Complexity: Understand time and space complexity.
Optimize After Correctness: Ensure correctness first, then optimize.

##### Learning and Improvement
###### Review Solutions: Learn from official solutions and different approaches.
Practice Regularly: Consistent practice enhances skills.
Reflect on Mistakes: Learn from errors to avoid repeating them.
